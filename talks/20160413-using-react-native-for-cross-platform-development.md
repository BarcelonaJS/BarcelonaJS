I'd like to give an introduction on how to get started with developing cross-platform mobile applications (iOS and Android) in React Native. Some knowledge of how React works is useful, but I'd quickly go through the basic components to refresh them. 

I want to focus on answering three questions:
* What is React Native useful for?
* Who is React Native useful for?
* What do I need to learn to launch my first app?
