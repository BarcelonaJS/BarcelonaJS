# Cross platform mobile development with React Native

This talk was about developing cross-platform mobile apps using React Native. We talked about the developer experience, advantages and limitations of the platform, and whether it's a viable alternative for creating great real world products.

In particular the talk was focused on the following questions:

* What is React Native useful for?
* Who is React Native useful to?
* What do I need to learn to launch my first app?
* What are the (business) advantages of using React Native?

Slides from the talk are available online: [Cross-platform mobile developement with React Native](https://speakerdeck.com/sharnik/cross-platform-mobile-development-with-react-native). However, you miss the magic of animated gifs and the soothing voice of the speaker. Well, next time just come to the meetup.
