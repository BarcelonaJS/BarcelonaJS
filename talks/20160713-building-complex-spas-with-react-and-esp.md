What does it take to build a complex single page application (SPA)? How do you model state in a way that can be reasoned with yet scales with functionality and remains maintainable? How do you separate your view code from your state and update state in a deterministic manor? We'll answer these questions using a real world open source sample application, [Reactive Trader](https://github.com/AdaptiveConsulting/ReactiveTraderCloud), build on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and Evented State Processor ([esp-js](https://github.com/esp/esp-js)).
