I want to talk about Hermes. This is an in-progress concept on how [asynchronous microservices architecture (based on message brokers, such as RabbitMQ)](http://www.slideshare.net/bpedro/asynchronous-microservices-in-nodejs) could also be used in frontend. The fact of using Node.js for microservices allow us to share code with frontend, but a new concept is being investigated about *sharing infrastructure*. At a glance, you could see you can do a backend without a REST API, event-based (instead of request-based) and a [backend for frontend](http://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/) approach. Curious about it? Join us to learn and discuss about it.
