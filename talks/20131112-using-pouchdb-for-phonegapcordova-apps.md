# Using PouchDB for PhoneGap/Cordova apps

This talk will focus on my experiences deploying Android apps that sync with CouchDB. I will focus mostly on PouchDB but will also discuss the other frameworks I have been using to deploy Android applications (Backbone.js, Coconut, GCM/Urban Airship, PhoneGap/Cordova).
