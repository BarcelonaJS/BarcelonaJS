We all love Twitter Bootstrap, it's a great tool to make responsive design easily and cross-browser. Sadly too many followed the same approach and the web nowadays looks all the same. The departure of Adobe Flash created a gap into the creativity of web designers and I think that now is time to fill it with a proper alternative: a WYSIWYG editor to build automatically complex HTML5 code. I found in Tumult Hype the best tool out there to start this change right now and I would like to share my experience with you! :)
