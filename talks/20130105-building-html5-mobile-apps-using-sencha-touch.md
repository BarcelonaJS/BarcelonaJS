# Building HTML5 mobile apps using Sencha Touch

A walk-through of the process of building a mobile app using Sencha Touch (with live coding). From creating and deploying using Sencha CMD, through architecting using Sencha Touch's class system, loader and layout system, to styling using Sencha Touch's compass and Sass theme. Wrapped into why and when you should use this framework, as well as what the future may look like.
