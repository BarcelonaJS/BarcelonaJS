Mozilla, Google and other browser makers are hard at work standardizing new Web APIs that will extend the abilities of the web. One such API is the [MediaRecorder](url) which will allow Javascript to very easily record media streams such as video or audio from different sources and save them or potentially manipulate them using other web APIs.

On this talk I will explain the current version of the MediaRecorder and provide examples of code snippets that can be used to capture and encode audio and video from the browser. Depending on the time constrains it might also be possible to include pointers for manipulating the data from the streams using something like Web Audio API.

I will give this talk as a Mozilla volunteer in the Tech Speakers program.
