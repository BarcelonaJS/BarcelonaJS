There is currently a major shift sweeping over the software industry. We went from monolithic apps, to API-driven apps, and now software engineers are breaking their apps into "micro-services".
Managing and connecting those different micro-services could be a hassle for DevOps.
AWS offers an interesting service with Lambda that let you create microservices easily for a very cheap price. With the recent announcement of the API gateway, it lets you create a 100% serverless microservice-based infrastructure for your API and app.

To simplify the creation and the maintenance of a such infrastructure, the community have came up with a framework: Serverless (previously: JAWS)
In this talk we will cover serverless principles using AWS Lambda and Serverless framework to build APIs.
