### Why Elm?

Elm is slowly becoming a lot of people's favourite language and this talk will show you why. 
Created by Evan Czaplicki as his thesis, the language tries to solve the problem of maintainability of JS code by reimagining how we code UI. 

Elm is a purely functional programming language inspired by languages like Haskell that compiles into JS, HTML and CSS.

This talk will show everyone how Elm can improve your ui coding by avoiding state, blowing your mind and making you a better programmer in general.
