# Generators & Async Function introduction

An introductory talk about async function the new feature proposed for JS2016 (a.k.a ES7). I will follow the next sequence:

-Introduction to function generators (a few sentences, but mostly code examples)
-Introduction of async function (a few sentence, but mostly code examples)
-How to create a wrapper function which allows to use function generators as async functions to show that async functions are basically syntax sugar.
-To end, I will show an example (simple by more practical than the others) of using an async function to retrieve the list of the files in a folder with .js extension
