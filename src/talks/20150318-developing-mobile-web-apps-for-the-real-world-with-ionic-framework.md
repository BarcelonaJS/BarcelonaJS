# Developing mobile web apps for the real world with Ionic Framework

It is well-known that develop in Android and iOS is a hardest task. For many companies the cost of develop and maintain two parallel environments is very expensive, and of course for a logic reason it isn't a good approach. At present, Many solutions exist to solve this, PhoneGap, Xamarin, the recent but only introduced ReactJS Native and of course Ionic. In this speech I will show how it works with some demos and the pros and cons about to use Ionic to develop web mobile apps for the real world.
