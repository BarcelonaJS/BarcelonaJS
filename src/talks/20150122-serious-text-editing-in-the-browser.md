# Serious text editing in the browser

When a textarea doesn't cut it anymore, there are alternatives: full-featured text and code editors written in browser JavaScript. This talk is about CodeMirror, one such editor. It'll explore the intricacies of faking an editable control, the challenges of making it scale to hundreds of thousands of lines, and the integration of modern code editor features.
