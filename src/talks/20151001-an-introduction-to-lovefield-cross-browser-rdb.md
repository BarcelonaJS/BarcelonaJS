# An introduction to Lovefield, cross-browser RDB

In this talk I will give an introduction to [Lovefield](https://google.github.io/lovefield/), a cross-browser SQL-Like, relational query engine for web, written purely in Javascript.
I will make an introduction why has been created, what problems it does help to solve, its quirks and the reasons of them.
I will also briefly introduce [sql.js](https://github.com/kripken/sql.js/) to end up with a live simple demo comparing both.
