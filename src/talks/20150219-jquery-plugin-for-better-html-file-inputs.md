# jQuery plugin for better HTML file inputs

Have you ever wanted to style an HTML file input in a easy way? I did, so I took [this guide](quirksmode.org/dom/inputfile.html) And turned it into a [jQuery plugin](plugins.jquery.com/enhancedfileinput/). [Here are some slides](http://www.developingandstuff.com/2013/01/jquery-plugin-for-better-html-file.html) I made for colognejs.de about developing it with Jasmine specs.
