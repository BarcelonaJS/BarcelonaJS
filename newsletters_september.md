BarcelonaJS September 2015

# Upcoming Events
## 28.08. BBQ.js
We were hoping to find a sponsor for the beers, and since we did not find one, and to make more accessible the event, we drop the 5 euro, but in return you need to bring your own beer/drinks and your food for the grill, meet/vegies/etc.

## 05.09. JSCodeRetreat #3
It's the [3rd JSCodeRetreat](http://www.meetup.com/BarcelonaJS/events/224140340/) hosted by BarcelonaJS. A hands-on day-long practice event to become a better JavaScript developer. We're looking forward to see you there. Some testimonials from the previous sessions:

> "Very nice philosophical discussion about cells suicide and the root of life in a procedural vs. an object perspective ;-). Good atmosphere and nice people! Thanks" – Julien


> "Thank you! It was lots of fun." – amir


> "Really interesting meetup. A good way of practicing and improving your JS skills! Thanks to all! [...]" – Xavier


## 09.09. BarcelonaJS
We're starting the first session this year with a talk by Alejandro Gómez, a speaker from SpainJS, talking about Functional Programming and Architecture in JavaScript. If you have a second topic, [please propose your talk here](https://github.com/BarcelonaJS/BarcelonaJS/issues/new?title=Your%20Awesome%20Talk&body=---%0Alevel:%20beginner%20%7C%20advanced%20%7C%20expert%0Alanguage:%20en%20%7C%20es%0Atwitter:%20YourTwitterHandle%0Atags:%0A%20%20-%20hello%0A%20%20-%20node%0A---%0A%0AYour%20awesome%20talk%20description)


## NodeConf Barcelona in "Nodevember"
A little sneak peek: we're looking for a date and time in November to organise our second NodeJS event, now under the official name "NodeConf Barcelona". It's going to be a small and cozy event, we'll send you details once the fog clears up.

# The BarcelonaJS Association & Transparency
In brief, what happened since the last meetup back in May: during the process of organising the MediterráneaJS event, unfortunately one of the founders resigned, and we were forced to figure out quickly how to accept new members, and how to change the structure of the organization. The result of that is, we have a membership form and a process in place to allow new members in.

After MediterráneaJS we all needed a little break, which was a bit longer than anticipated, but required to gather some energy. After that we held an informal session (with the people that run regular events that are JS themed) about the future of BarcelonaJS as an association. The transcript of the discussion can found on [GitHub](https://github.com/BarcelonaJS/barcelonajs.org/issues/73).

For new and existing members there will be a yearly fee to become a part of the association, which will be used to pay fees like Meetup.com (US$29.94 every 6 months) and an accountant (approximately 45€ monthly) to take care of the finances and taxes, etc, all of which is currently paid from our private pockets. You don't need to be a associate/member to come to BarcelonaJS events!

What members get in return; each member has a vote on internal decisions and gets a @barcelonajs.org address, discounts on conferences (the monthly events are and will be free, of course) and other perks, to be discussed and approved accordingly to the "status" of the association.

All this have to be voted in the upcoming General Meeting of the association. If you find value in what BarcelonaJS does, consider becoming a member and help grow a stronger community.

Finally, none of our founders is Catalan, so it takes extra time and effort to understand local circumstances. But since we love the city and the community, we're going the extra mile to make things work. If you see or feel we're doing something wrong, please tell us right away so we can investigate and correct it.


## Legal structure
The 'Associacio de grup d’usuaris de JavaScript de Barcelona' (in short "BarcelonaJS"), has as required by law, three minimum members, as from the 5th of June, 2015:

  1. President: Jean Carlos Meninno
  2. Secretary: Isabel Cabezas
  3. Treasurer: Patrick Heneise

New members are required to fill the membership form that we'll make available to everyone soon.


## Finance
Our goal is to maintain a nice community of JavaScript enthusiasts. In order to pay certain services like meetup.com and organise conferences, we have founded the "Associacio de grup d’usuaris de JavaScript de Barcelona", which has the legal form of a non-profit organisation and is controlled and monitored by the Catalan Generalitat.

A full financial report of all expenses and income for BarcelonaJS, which will cover everything related to MediterráneaJS as well, is in progress and will be published soon. Our apologies for it has taken so long, but we're just humans beings with family (or cats) and day jobs. The short version is: BarcelonaJS lost around 2000 Euro that we compensated with BarcelonaJS sponsorship (many thanks to [RedRadix](https://www.redradix.com) and [3Scale](http://www.3scale.net)) but by also paying money ourselves, apart from the hundreds of unpaid hours spend on organisation of the conference and monthly events. None of the associates of BarcelonaJS got any profit out of the conference or any other BarcelonaJS income.

Some of you were wondering why we hired a catering service, an event producer or other services for MediterráneaJS and there's a simple answer to that: MediterráneaJS (with a total of 242 registrations for all the events that happened) was organised by a total of 3 people with support of a few more: Sergio, Sam and David, which we would like to thank again at this point. We're all engineers, but none of us is a cook; and even less are we event producers with years of experience in organizing events. And as other people hire software developers to program JavaScript for them, we hired professionals to make sure the event was a success. Rest assured, everything we could have done ourselves, we did.


## Made by BarcelonaJS
Among our conferences and events, BarcelonaJS is active in open source contributions. We're working hard together with the chaps from LNUG on a piece of software called "GitEvents" - an event management service based on GitHub. Code contributions are always welcome at https://github.com/gitevents and we're also organizing hack-events or [Pair Programming sessions](https://github.com/GitEvents/core/issues/78).


## The Mission
Our mission is and always will be to provide a safe and neutral space for JavaScript and technology enthusiasts to meet, exchange, enjoy great talks and good company. The association is only a legal framework to handle financial transactions (services, domains etc. that have to be paid). The events will go on as usual, same day every month (mostly), same time, same (free) beer and great company. If you want to do more within the community, we'd like to invite you to become a member of the association and bring in your ideas. Even without a membership, the entire event is hosted open-source on GitHub and you can propose changes and modifications to everything.

Thanks for reading and we hope to see you fresh and relaxed from the summer holidays soon!
